                <p>
                    I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on the
                    interaction of algorithms and networks, and the roles they play in
                    large-scale social and information systems. My work has been supported by
                    an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a MacArthur
                    Foundation Fellowship, a Packard Foundation Fellowship, a Simons
                    Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, a Vannevar Bush Faculty
                    Fellowship, and grants from Facebook, Google, Yahoo, the MacArthur
                    Foundation, the ARO, and the NSF. I am a member of the National Academy of
                    Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of
                    Arts and Sciences.

                <a href="https://youtube.com/"> In Spring 2021, Karen Levy and I are teaching a new course, Choices
                    and Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340). The course is
                    designed at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and
                    will cover a range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of
                    computing and information.</a>

            <ol>
                <li>This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach entitled Networks. The book, like
                    the
                    course, is designed at the introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites. To support
                    deeper explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented with optional advanced sections.</li>
